## The Code
As you might or might not have noticed, we aren't on the [master](https://github.com/MrGcGamer/JumpSkipReborn/tree/master) branch, and the code looks quite cryptic... I had a bit of fun with the code, if you want to have a clearer picture of what's going on, I'd recommend looking at the [master](https://github.com/MrGcGamer/JumpSkipReborn/tree/master) branch with the "cleaner", mostly equivalent implementation.
